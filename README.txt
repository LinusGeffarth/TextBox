TextBox - README

This little piece of code does - as unprofessionally as it's written - create a draggable and resizable text box just how it can be found in many system apps on Mac OS X (macOS).
It can be fairly easily modified, consist of Swift 2.2 and Objective-C.
I made (few) comments or better understanding.
Have fun using it, if it helps anyone :)
